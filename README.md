# Java Stdin and Stdout Ib

This repository contains a concise solution for handling standard input and output (stdin and stdout) in Java.

## Problem Description

In many programming problems, especially in competitive programming, you often need to read input from standard input (stdin) and print output to standard output (stdout). This is commonly required when solving problems on platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codeforces.

## Solution

This Java program demonstrates a simple solution to read input from stdin and print it to stdout. It utilizes the `Scanner` class to read input from the console and the `System.out.println()` method to print output.

## Usage

To use this solution:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file using any Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Input data when prompted, and observe the output on the console.

## Example

```
Input:
5
10
15
20
25
30

Output:
5
10
15
20
25
30
```
